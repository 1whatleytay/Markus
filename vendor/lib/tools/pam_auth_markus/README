MarkUs PAM Authentication Helper
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This program allows you to use Linux PAM for MarkUs authentication.
Note: At the moment only Linux is supported. It shouldn't be too
hard to support openpam platforms such as Mac OSX though.

Installation:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

  1. Make sure you have PAM development files installed. E.g. on
     a Debian based system install them by:
     	#> aptitude install libpam0g-dev
  2. Compile by
        $> make
  3. Install binary and default configuration by
        #> make -s install
     Note: You have to do this step as root.
  4. Change MarkUs PAM configuration as desired.
     MarkUs pam configuration is in /etc/pam.d/markus_pam 

Basic Testing:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

  $> echo -e 'username\npassword' | /usr/local/bin/markus_pam; \
     echo "Return code was: $?"

  If there were PAM authentication failures, an error message
  will be printed to stderr and "Return code was 1" printed to
  stdout. Conversely, if everything went fine you should see
  "Return code was 0".

  You may want to put the following line into /etc/pam.d/markus_pam:
    auth required pam_permit.so
  Note this will always succeed if your Linux PAM is properly in
  place.


MarkUs Configuration:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

  Once you are sure markus_pam works as desired, set
    VALIDATE_FILE = "/usr/local/bin/markus_pam"
  and you should be all set.
